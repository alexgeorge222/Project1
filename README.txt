This project is a website running off of asp.net razor v3 and jquery mobile. In order to run it,
extract all the files to a document folder labled Project 1, and then open that in Microsoft Visual 
Studio by selecting File/Open Website/Than find the File you just created. The only thing that needs
to be done afterwords is updating the path to the xml file on line 17 of Login.cshtml. Other than that
The site works on a basic level, you can't create an account yet but you can log in using one of the accounts
listed in the users.xml file in the Login folder.
