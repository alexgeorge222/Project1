This project is a website running off of asp.net razor v3, html and jquery mobile, with a sql database attached (as php and asp.net tend to not play well together, there is no php in the project). In order to run it,
extract all the files to a document folder labled Project 1, and then open that in Microsoft Visual 
Studio by selecting File/Open Website/Than find the File you just created. The only thing that needs
to be done afterwords is updating the path to the xml file on line 17 of Login.cshtml.Also you can now make an account, just be aware that due to some glitch with the submit button you have to hit it twice for it to create, and you can double check the xml file included in login to confirm this. The other addition are the review tab, and the VAPE game, which yes, I stole the idea from the popular MBMBAM podcast. Essentially it reads in names and scores from a database, and it spit out two to the user, who then picks one. The name and score of that person is then shown back to the user, with the base score going up by one. This keeps going until you find the joke unfunny, which is roughly after you realize that yes, Jesus vapes harder than the Ghost of Wilfered Brimley. I've included the table I used(in powerpoint form because that's how SQL let me export a databse), and the server can be set up by updating the code to go to a server running off you machine. This can be found using the VAPE button on the default page
